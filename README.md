Permadeath Mod
==============

This mod prevents you from respawning when you die. Your only options are to reload a save or end the map.

This is my first Factorio mod, but it's extremely simple (only about 3 lines), so it should be very stable.

Removing the ability to save/load is not currently in scope for this mod. It's recommended that you either disable autosaving entirely or set it to a long interval (like an hour or so) to precvent save-scumming.
